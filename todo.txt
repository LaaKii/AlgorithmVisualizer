- show tooltips on right side
- remove unnecessary console output
- disallow change of search algorithm when search started
- implement forest like structure to make use of weighted algorithm
- read algorithms from textfile
- lambda in bidirectional swarm... Nothing to add... :D
- TEST!!!!
- Villt. currentIndex als Map implementieren
- search algorithms should extend instead of implement, because of same members
- depth-first-search seems not to work properly (going up)
