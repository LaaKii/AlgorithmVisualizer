- show tooltips on right side
- remove unnecessary console output
- disallow change of search algorithm when search started
- implement forest like structure to make use of weighted algorithm
- read algorithms from textfile
- lambda in bidirectional swarm... Nothing to add... :D
- tests
- currentIndex could be implemented as a map for faster access
- search algorithms should extend instead of implement, because of same members
- depth-first-search seems not to work properly (going up)
- set attributes, like wall, goal, start in a enum or Strings
